There is a seemingly known bug with hudson where its svn plugin does
not retrieve svn:externals files.  This means that the
version.properties file is not properly retrieved.  There is a test
directory in org.protege.editor.core.application that we can use to
determine when this bug is closed.  In the meantime we will run a
cronjob that does nightly copies of the version.properties from the trunk.

There is also a bug with the properties plugin that is in progress.
